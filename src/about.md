# About the Author

**Andrew Morgan** is a data engineer, consultant, and author with nearly two decades of experience building data platforms and data quality tools across financial services, telecoms, and public sector organisations.

He is the author of *Mastering Spark for Data Science* (Packt Publishing, 2017), a 542-page reference covering exploratory data analysis, data quality profiling, graph analytics, natural language processing, and large-scale machine learning with Apache Spark. Chapter 4 of that book introduced the mask-based profiling techniques that form the foundation of the DQOR framework described here.

Andrew is the creator of **bytefreq**, originally written in awk in 2007 and now reimplemented in Rust, and **DataRadar**, a browser-based WASM profiler for locked-down environments. He led the development of **DQPRE** (Data Quality Profiler and Rules Engine), a Spark-based enterprise data quality tool now open-sourced by the UK Home Office, which has been proven at the scale of UK central government.

His current work at **Zenkai Laboratories** focuses on data operating model design and data platform architecture consulting, helping organisations build the capabilities needed to manage data quality, governance, and engineering at scale.

Andrew believes that data quality should not require a PhD or an enterprise licence — just a clear idea and a good tool.
