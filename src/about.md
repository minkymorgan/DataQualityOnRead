# About the Author

**Andrew Morgan** is a data engineer, architect, and consultant with nearly two decades of experience building data platforms and data quality tools across financial services, government, and telecoms.

He is the author of *Mastering Spark for Data Science* (Packt Publishing, 2017), a 542-page reference covering exploratory data analysis, data quality profiling, graph analytics, natural language processing, and large-scale machine learning with Apache Spark. Chapter 4 of that book introduced the mask-based profiling techniques that form the foundation of the DQOR framework described here.

Andrew has applied these techniques at scale across a range of organisations:

- **UK Government (Home Office, DSA, Cabinet Office, and others):** Advisor to the leadership teams of several central government organisations. Designed and delivered a programme to assess data maturity and set out strategic transformation recommendations across whole organisations, including a recommended data capabilities architecture down to level 3. Acting Product Manager for a large Data Assurance team reporting to the CTO, where he proposed the data governance operating model for very large and complex datasets, and designed and managed the build of a modern data profiling tool — now open-sourced as [DQPRE](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/data-quality-profiler-and-rules-engine).
- **Schroders:** Chief Architect for the design of an enterprise-wide AWS data enablement platform.
- **Zenkai Laboratories:** His current consultancy, focused on data operating model design, data platform architecture, and AI strategy.

Andrew is the creator of **bytefreq**, originally written in awk in 2007 and now reimplemented in Rust, and **DataRadar**, a browser-based WASM profiler for locked-down environments where installing software is not possible. He believes that data quality should not require a PhD or an enterprise licence — just a clear idea and a good tool.
