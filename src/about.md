# About the Author

**Andrew Morgan** is a data engineer and author of *Mastering Spark for Data Science* (Packt Publishing). He has spent nearly two decades working with data at scale, from financial services to telecoms, and has been building mask-based data profiling tools since 2007.

He is the creator of **bytefreq** and **dataradar**, and believes that data quality shouldn't require a PhD or an enterprise licence — just a clear idea and a good tool.
