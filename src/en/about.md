# About the Author {.unnumbered}

**Andrew Morgan** is a data engineer, architect, and consultant with nearly two decades of experience building data platforms and data quality tools across financial services, government, and telecoms.

He is the author of *Mastering Spark for Data Science* (Packt Publishing, 2017), a 542-page reference covering exploratory data analysis, data quality profiling, graph analytics, natural language processing, and large-scale machine learning with Apache Spark. Chapter 4 of that book introduced the mask-based profiling techniques that form the foundation of the DQOR framework described here.

Andrew is the creator of **bytefreq**, originally written in awk in 2007 and now reimplemented in Rust, and **DataRadar**, a browser-based WASM profiler for locked-down environments where installing software is not possible. His current work at **Gamakon** focuses on data quality tooling, data platform architecture, and consulting.

He believes that data quality should not require a PhD or an enterprise licence — just a clear idea and a good tool.
